- Applying the Fuzzy Set theory : 

+ Takes the image as 'brain3.jpg' and outputs the corresponding segmented image with the tumors being made clearer 
(bolder than other parts)

2.  Picture Fuzzy Set Clustering 

-   Picture Fuzzy Set based Clustering is proved to have better clustering quality than the Fuzzy Set based Clustering 

- Applying the Picture Fuzzy Set theory : 

+ Implementing ...
